## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+

- Coinbase SDK API key
- OpenAI API Key

## Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the cointoss directory:
```bash
cd examples/cointoss
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```

3. Copy the example environment file and fill in your values:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Required Environment Variables

- `WALLET_KEY`: Your agent's wallet private key for XMTP
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY`: XMTP encryption key
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (if needed)
- `KEY`: Encryption key for local wallet storage (or use ENCRYPTION_KEY if not provided)

### Coinbase API Configuration (required)
You must set EITHER the COINBASE_ or CDP_ prefixed versions of these variables:

- `COINBASE_API_KEY_NAME` or `CDP_API_KEY_NAME`: Your Coinbase API key name exactly as shown in the Coinbase developer dashboard

- `COINBASE_API_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY` or `CDP_API_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your Coinbase API private key in PEM format. Must include:
  ```
  -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
  MIIEvQIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCBKcwggSjAgEA...
  ...many more lines...
  -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
  ```

  To properly format your private key for .env file:
  ```bash
  # If your key is in a file:
  cat your_key.pem | awk '{printf "%s\\n", $0}' | tr -d '\n'
  
  # Then paste the result into your .env after COINBASE_API_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY= or CDP_API_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY=
  ```

### Optional Environment Variables
- `COINBASE_APP_ID`: Your Coinbase app ID for on-ramp features
- `REDIS_URL`: Redis connection URL for storage (defaults to local storage)

4. Build the project:
```bash
yarn build
```

5. Start the agent:
```bash
yarn start
```

For development with more detailed logs:
```bash
yarn dev
```

## Usage

The agent operates in group chats and responds when tagged with `@toss`.

### Available Commands

- `@toss create <amount>` - Create a new coin toss game with specified USDC bet amount
- `@toss join <gameId>` - Join an existing game with the specified ID
- `@toss execute <gameId>` - Execute the coin toss (only for game creator)
- `@toss status <gameId>` - Check the status of a specific game
- `@toss list` - List all active games
- `@toss balance` - Check your wallet balance and address
- `@toss help` - Show available commands

### Example Flow

1. **Invite the bot** to your XMTP group chat

2. **Create a game**:
   ```
   @toss create 0.01
   ```
   This creates a game with a 0.01 USDC bet. The creator is assigned Player ID P1 and automatically pays the bet amount.

3. **Other players join** using the game ID:
   ```
   @toss join 1
   ```
   Each player is assigned a Player ID (P2, P3, etc.) and pays the bet amount.

4. **Check game status** any time:
   ```
   @toss status 1
   ```
   Shows current players, bet amount, prize pool, and other details.

5. **Execute the coin toss** (creator only):
   ```
   @toss execute 1
   ```
   When the creator is ready, they execute the coin toss. A random winner is chosen, and the prize pool is transferred to their wallet.

6. **Results** are displayed showing all players, the winner, and payment confirmation.

## Player Identification

Each player is assigned a simple ID for easy reference:
- **P1**: Always the game creator
- **P2, P3, ...**: Players who join later

Player wallet addresses are displayed in all game information for transparency.

## Prize Pool and Payouts

- All bets are collected in a dedicated game wallet
- Total prize pool = bet amount Ã— number of players
- When the game creator executes the coin toss, a random winner is selected
- The entire prize pool is transferred to the winner's wallet
- Payment status is reported after the game

## Troubleshooting

### Wallet Creation Errors

If you see errors like `Failed to create wallet: APIError` when trying to create a game or check balance:

1. **Coinbase API Keys**: 
   - Check that your `COINBASE_API_KEY_NAME` exactly matches the key name in your Coinbase Developer Dashboard
   - Ensure `COINBASE_API_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY` contains the complete PEM-formatted private key including `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----` lines
   - If your private key contains newlines, they must be properly preserved in the `.env` file or replaced with `\n` 

2. **Network Issues**:
   - Verify that you have internet connectivity and can reach Coinbase's API endpoints
   - Check if there are any service outages on Coinbase's status page

3. **Permissions**:
   - Confirm your API key has the necessary permissions in the Coinbase developer portal
   - The API key needs permissions for wallet creation and management

4. **Key Format**:
   - If your private key is in a file, you can use this command to properly format it for .env:
     ```bash
     cat your_key.pem | awk '{printf "%s\\n", $0}' | tr -d '\n'
     ```
   - Then paste the result into your .env file

5. **Try with CDP prefix**:
   - If you're using `COINBASE_API_KEY_NAME` and `COINBASE_API_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY`, try using 
     `CDP_API_KEY_NAME` and `CDP_API_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY` instead for backwards compatibility

### Running the Agent

For best results when starting the agent:

1. Make sure all environment variables are set correctly in your `.env` file
2. Run the agent in development mode to see more detailed logs:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
3. Watch for any specific error messages in the console that might give more details

If you're still encountering issues, try clearing your local wallet data:
```bash
rm -rf .data/wallets
```
